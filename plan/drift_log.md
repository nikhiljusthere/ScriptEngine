# drift_log.md — the map back to the trunk

## STANDING RULES — repeated in every plan document, deliberately

*Verbatim copy of `plan/STANDING_RULES.md`. Duplicated across `flow.md`,
`Plan_to_perfection.md` and `drift_log.md` so that reading any one plan
document is sufficient, even if work drifts far enough that only one is in
view.*

**1. No user input. None, for the duration of this plan.** Every wall where you
would normally stop and ask — a design fork, an ambiguous result, a blocked
step, a judgement call — **run `llm-council` instead.** The council decides;
you act on its verdict and record it. Do not ask for approval, which option, or
whether to proceed. The only stop is the halt path in `flow.md`, and that runs
a council first. Council claims are DB-verified before recording; one that
cannot be verified did not happen.

**2. The GPU is available. Do not default to CPU.** Qwen's compute idles while
a shell command runs, and its resident weights leave ~7.4 GB free on the 32 GB
card — enough for the ~5.3 GB retrieval stack. Tests, the `:8000` server and
the census run on GPU **without stopping Qwen**. *(Measured 2026-09-07:
ninfer-serve 24,670 MiB + a co-located retrieval process 6,186 MiB, 991 MiB
spare — co-location working under real load.)* Two qualifications: check
`nvidia-smi` free memory first and size the job against it, since with a job
already co-located the spare can fall under 1 GB; and a sustained 27B
extraction batch wants the card to itself (one OOM-crashed at 508/524 beside
the reranker). GPU is the default; CPU needs a measured reason.

**3. Council cadence — three mandatory points.** (a) **Every 2–3 completed
todos**, a council reviewing *the fixes just made* — did they do what they
claimed? (b) **At the end of every sub-list** (`1a–1d`, `X1.a–X1.f`), a council
assessing whether the sub-list actually completed, **before the return pointer
fires** — a sub-list is done when a council says the work holds, not when its
last line is reached. (c) **At every phase gate**, the gate council already
specified. Write each to `reports/comprehension/COUNCIL_<subject>.md` and
commit it with the work it reviewed. If it is not on disk, it did not happen.

---

**Why this file exists.** Work leaves the plan. A council redirects, a gate
fails, a diagnosis opens a sub-sequence — and three excursions later nobody can
say which document is authoritative or where the trunk was left. This file is
the map back.

**This is history, not status.** It is append-only: each entry records what
*happened*, which does not go stale. It never records what *remains* — that is
the claim that produced four phantom work items. `flow.md` holds structure,
this file holds history, status comes from a query. See
`Plan_to_perfection.md` §0.

---

## 1. Addressing

**The trunk is `flow.md`.** Its phases are the only authoritative numbering.
Address a trunk step as `P<phase>.<step>` — `P3.A`, `P0.D`.

**Everything else is an excursion.** An excursion is any ordered work that is
not a trunk step: a council-directed sequence, a fix loop, a diagnostic sweep.
Address it as `X<n>.<step>` — `X1.a`, `X1.b`. An excursion **never** takes a
phase number, even when its own internal notes use one.

> **The collision that made this necessary.** "Phase 5" currently means two
> different things: `flow.md` Phase 5 (the subjective-prose extraction phase,
> now closed) and the executing agent's own "Phase 5 Step 1–5" retrieval
> sequence. Both are internally coherent. Together they are unresolvable
> without this file. **From here: excursions get `X` numbers, never `P`.**

---

## 2. The return rule

**Every excursion's last item is a return pointer.** Not "continue," not "next"
— an explicit trunk address.

```
X1.a → X1.b → X1.c → X1.d → X1.e: RETURN TO P3.A
```

The rule holds recursively: an excursion spawned inside an excursion returns to
its parent's next item, and the parent still returns to the trunk. A todo list
without a terminal return pointer is malformed — **write the return item first,
when the excursion opens, not when it closes.** By the time it closes, the
reason it opened has usually been forgotten.

**A return pointer names where the trunk was left, not where it feels natural
to resume.** If an excursion discovered something that should change the trunk,
that is an edit to `flow.md` with its own drift entry — not a quietly different
return address.

## 3. Drift ledger

### D1 — Phase 5 closed early, becoming a verification excursion
- **Trunk step:** `P5` (subjective prose: Personality, Appearance, Overview,
  Trivia, History — ~106,000 words).
- **What happened:** `P1.A` (the held-out oracle) returned E1–E4 all passing —
  retrieval already served the Personality paragraphs. `flow.md` P5's own
  premise says the phase opens *only* if E1–E4 fail. Premise refuted, phase
  closed without extraction.
- **Why it is not a deviation:** the plan predicted and authorised this. P5 was
  written as conditional. The measurement removed the phase, which is the
  design working.
- **What it spawned:** rather than closing on n=4, a scaled verification —
  see X1.
- **Status of the trunk step:** closed. ~106,000 words need no extraction.

### D2 — the F-gate vocabulary
- **What happened:** the census work introduced local acceptance labels `F1`
  (breadcrumb component matcher), `F2b` (the acceptance test), `F3` (the
  tier-scoped gate).
- **Assessment:** a sub-vocabulary inside X1, not a numbering scheme. Harmless,
  but it is *not* a trunk address and must not be cited as one.

### D3 — X1, the retrieval-only sequence (the current excursion)
- **Opened from:** `P5` closure, by council
  (`reports/comprehension/COUNCIL_phase5-next-move.md`).
- **Its own internal name:** "Phase 5 Step 1–5". **Correct address: X1.**
- **Mandate:** prove at scale that retrieval *serves* the five prose dimensions
  P5 declined to extract. Retrieval-only — no 27B extraction, by council
  ruling, because the 27B path OOM-crashed at 508/524 when co-located with the
  reranker.
- **Items:**
  - `X1.a` F2b fix + gates + commit (`dedb949`) — done
  - `X1.b` build + validate the census harness — done
  - `X1.c` run the 545 census on GPU, summarise — done
    (`reports/comprehension/STEP5_CENSUS_545.md`: 98.7% reached, 0 main-cast
    misses, 7 not-reached, all minor tier)
  - `X1.d` fork — fix the 2 genuine faults, or close out and track — **open**
  - `X1.e` record the census milestone in the live docs — **open**
  - `X1.f` copy the harness into the repo — done (`tools/census_545.py`,
    `tools/census_545_pairs.json`)
  - `X1.g` **RETURN TO P3.A** ← added here; the excursion had no return pointer
- **Drift note:** X1 was opened without a return item. That is precisely the
  failure this file exists to prevent, and it is recorded rather than
  retro-fitted silently.

### D4 — P3 gains the P5 gate (a trunk edit, not a drift)
- **What changed:** `flow.md` P3 (ability depth) was written as extraction
  work: widen `abilities` to 146 characters, extract mechanics.
- **Why it changes:** P5 closed because a cheap retrieval measurement proved
  extraction unnecessary. The ability family has had **no such measurement** —
  no census, no oracle item, no report mentions Cursed Technique, Physical
  Prowess or Cursed Energy. Building extraction there without first running the
  test that closed P5 would repeat the mistake P5 avoided.
- **The edit:** P3 opens with a measurement step, and its extraction steps are
  conditional on that measurement, exactly as P5 was.

## 4. Current position

**Trunk:** `P0` done · `P1` done · `P2` done (oracle 17/18, only C1 open — the
documented repeat-encounter expected-fail) · **`P3` next** · `P4` not started ·
`P5` closed by D1 · `P6` not started.

**Excursion:** X1 open at `X1.d`, `X1.e`; returns to `P3.A` at `X1.g`.

**The unmeasured block, and why P3 is next:** five ability dimensions —
Cursed Technique 13,611 w, Physical Prowess 10,595 w, Intelligence 9,674 w,
Abilities and Powers 8,481 w, Cursed Energy 6,416 w — **~48,800 words with zero
measurement of any kind.** The census harness that answered this question for
the prose dimensions now exists in `tools/` and runs in ~9 minutes on GPU.

## 5. Adding an entry

Append; never edit a past entry. One entry per drift.

```
### D<n> — <one line: what moved>
- **Trunk step:** <P address, or "none — excursion">
- **What happened:** <the event, with the evidence: commit, report, or query>
- **Why:** <premise refuted / council ruling / gate failure / trunk edit>
- **Return address:** <P address the work rejoins, or "trunk edit — no return">
```

A drift entry is not an apology and not a justification. It is an address.
